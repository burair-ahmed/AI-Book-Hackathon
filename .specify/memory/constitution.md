# Constitution: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Title:** "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World"  
**System:** Spec-Kit Plus  
**Implementation:** Claude Code  
**Deployment:** Docusaurus on GitHub Pages  

## 1. Educational Philosophy
*   **Bridge Software & Embodiment:** The book must bridge AI software systems with physical robotic embodiment.
*   **Core Emphasis:** Emphasize embodied intelligence, real-world physics, and human-centered design.
*   **Target Audience:** Assume readers already understand basic AI/ML concepts.

## 2. Technical Standards
*   **Middleware:** ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) is the canonical robotics middleware.
*   **Platforms:** NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Gazebo, Unity, and Jetson are first-class platforms.
*   **OS:** All examples must be Linux-first (Ubuntu 22.04).

## 3. Content Requirements
*   **Module Structure:** Every module must include:
    *   Conceptual theory
    *   Architecture diagrams (described textually)
    *   Code snippets (Python / ROS 2)
    *   Simulation workflows
    *   Real-world deployment notes
*   **Capstone:** Capstone must integrate Vision-Language-Action (VLA).

## 4. Documentation & UX
*   **Format:** Written in Markdown compatible with Docusaurus.
*   **Tone:** Modern, clean, professional tone. No fluff, no marketing language.
*   **Responsiveness:** Mobile-perfect responsive reading experience.

## 5. Output Discipline
*   **Completeness:** No skipped steps.
*   **Hardware:** No assumed hardware access.
*   **Alternatives:** Explicit hardware alternatives (local vs cloud).
